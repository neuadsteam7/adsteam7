<h2>Week 1</h2>
1) Data preprocessing (finding duplicates & augmentation)
2) Perform retraining of Inception V3 model from keras
3) Getting real time images from instagram and twitter for testing

__#Things in progress__
1) model building using keras
2) Visualization of retraining using tensorboard

<h2>#Week 2</h2>
1) Complete the model building
2) Perform analysis like logo visibility on the test results
3) WebApp
4) Deployment on AWS
5) Dockerizing the pipeline

__#Challenges faced__
1) The training dataset contained less number of images with real time backgrounds
